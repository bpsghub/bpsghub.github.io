## Secure Multi-Site Network Design & Security Implementation
In this project, I demonstrate my ability to design, implement, secure, and analyse an enterprise‑grade network environment. The environment simulates three enterprise buildings connected through secure routing, VPNs, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.

All infrastructure was built and tested inside GNS3, using MikroTik firewalls and multiple Ubuntu‑based servers.

This project showcases my capability to work end‑to‑end across network design, security engineering, threat detection, encryption, and incident response.

> Tools: GNS3, Mikrotik firewall, VPN, SnortIDS, Wireshark
